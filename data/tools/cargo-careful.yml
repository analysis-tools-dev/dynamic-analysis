    Execute Rust code carefully, with extra checking along the way.
    It builds the standard library with debug assertions.
    
    Here are some of the checks this enables:

    * `get_unchecked` in slices performs bounds checks
    * `copy`, `copy_nonoverlapping`, and `write_bytes` check that pointers are aligned and non-null and (if applicable) non-overlapping
    `{NonNull,NonZero*,...}::new_unchecked` check that the value is valid
    * plenty of internal consistency checks in the collection types
    * mem::zeroed and the deprecated mem::uninitialized panic if the type does not allow that kind of initialization
