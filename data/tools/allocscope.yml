  allocscope is a tool for tracking down where the most egregiously large
  allocations are occurring in a C, C++ or Rust codebase. It is particularly
  intendend to be useful for developers who want to get a handle on excessive
  allocations and are working in a large codebase with multiple contributors
  with allocations occuring in many modules or libraries.
